# tiermaker-template-generator

This app was made to make it easier to create templates for [Tiermaker](https://tiermaker.com/).

## How to use

(1) Save images you want to use in your template in a folder,
(2) Re-name each image to the text you want to show on top of them for the template,
(3) Run the app `py generator.py <path-to-folder>`.

Your images should show up in a new folder called `images_with_text` inside your original folder.

> Note: Make sure your images are under 800x800 pixels - the app will scale them to that size.
